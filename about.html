about!
<p>
  Hello, My name is Malik Hickman and I am a rising senior at Northumberland High School and Chesapeake Bay Governors School.
  I have two great parents, two brothers, and a big family to go along with them. I like to think that I'm decent at sports, as I play
  basketball, soccer, and track. Currently, I am playing on the Northumberland varisty soccer team. We plan to play in the regional
  tournament by next week. I also enjoy hunting and fishing with my dad, and playing video games. My favorite games to play are
  Valorant and Call of Duty. While I still don't know what branch I want to commit to, my main career goal is to pursue a career in
  engineering.

  After High School I plan to attend the University of Virginia Tech to receive a Bachelors degree in Engineering. I am currently
  working on getting my asscoiates degree by my senior year. As of May, I was fith in my class, so I probably will not be valendictorian.
  However, I am hoping to be one of the first members of my family to attend a major university. I was able to enroll in this course
  with the help of my teachers at Governors School. By taking this class I hope to become more knowledgeable in programming, 
  as it may give me more insight on a type of engineering career that I want to center myself around. The three credits towards 
  my Associates will also be very helpful.
