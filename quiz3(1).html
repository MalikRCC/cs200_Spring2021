1. Running a marathon is more like a for loop, in the sense that the distance for the run is already known from the start. The runners know that they have to keep moving repeatedly in order to reach the already known finish.
Cleaning dishes could serve as a for loop if you happen to know the number of dishes that you have to clean. However, I would consider this an example of a while loop, because it involves a user doing the same action until there arent anymore dishes left. Also the fact that its at a restaurant adds an additional sense of uncertainty for the completion of the task.
Serving each DMV customer is defintely an example of a while loop. IF you already knew the number of cutomers that had to be served, then this would be more of a for loop. However, DMVs always have a continous flow of customers arrving at different times of the day and workers are doing the same tasks repeatedly until everyone is served.

3. To trigger a funtion located in the script after the body has loaded by setting the onload equal to the function name.

4. Moore's law states that he observation that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit (IC) doubles about every two years. It applies to Random access memory chips, as the strage cpacity for these chips is stedily increasing. Memory also scales exceptionally well with transitor denstiy. A higher transistor density basically means you can pack more memory cells into the same package.

5. You can use setInterval to start a clock by creating a 1000 millisecond timer in the setInterval parameters. A timer fucntion would then need to be created under the setInterval. 
   You can use setTimeout to refer to a function and display an alert after a set time has passed.
